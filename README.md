## Module 10: Project to Analyze and Pull Data of Mars from the Internet using HTML and CSS styling
---
### Background
---
#### This project was to create a website app that pulled in current articles, pictures, and data from Mars across various websites. The following websites were used:
* #### News articles: https://redplanetscience.com/
* #### Featured pictures: https://spaceimages-mars.com
* #### Comparison of Mars vs Earth: https://data-class-marsfacts.s3.amazonaws.com/Mars_Facts/index.html
* #### Mars Hemisphere's Pictures: https://marshemispheres.com/
#### Each website had the html inspected to look for information out of each webpage. After inspecting, code was written to pull that information into a new webapp using Flask. After creating the webapp, functionality was coded to scrape new data anytime the articles, images, or data was changed by the original website owners causing the webapp to update after hitting the "Scrape New Data" button. This project used knowledge from Flask, Mongo, jupyter notebook, python, and html code; this project was apart of the UNC BootCamp Data Analytics course.
